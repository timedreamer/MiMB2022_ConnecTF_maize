This repo contains maize tissue-specific networks that we use for the MiMB chapter for Matt. The original networks were published at [Huang et al, 2018 BMC Plant Biology](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-018-1329-y).

The `data/maize_network` contains the input v3-id networks.

The `src` folder contains the script I used to convert tissue-specific GRNs from v3ids to v4ids.

The `result` folder contains the output v4-id networks.
